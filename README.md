## Contribution Workflow

1. [Create a repo fork in GitHub](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/)
1. [Clone the dcos/dcos-website repo](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)
1. Add repo fork as remote repo:

    ```
    git remote add fork https://github.com/<github-user>/dcos-website
    git fetch fork
    ```
1. Checkout the develop branch:

    ```
    git checkout develop
    ```

1. Create a new feature branch:

    ```
    git checkout -b feature/<feature-name>
    ```

1. Make local changes.

1. Test your changes [locally](#).

1. Add and commit changes:

    ```
    git add -p .
    git commit
    ```

1. Rebase repo fork to include recent `dcos/dcos-website:develop` changes. Rebasing a repo (instead of merging) will keep your fork commit history clean and move all your changes to the top of the commit log.

    ```
    git fetch origin
    git pull --rebase origin develop
    ```
    **Tip:** May require resolving conflicts.

1. Push changes to repo fork feature branch:

    ```
    git push -u fork feature/<feature-name>
    ```

1. [Create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) from the repo fork feature branch to `dcos/dcos-website:develop`.

Once changes are accepted and merged to the develop branch, CI will push the updates to <https://dev.dcos.io/>.

## Testing your updates locally


1.  Build a local version of the doc site. The DC/OS website can be built locally using Node or run in an Nginx Docker container.

- Using Easy Mode
    1. [Install Docker Toolkit](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-toolbox)

    1. Run dev server

        ```
        make
        ```

    1. Go to [running server](http://localhost:3000)

- Using Node
    1. [Install Node](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node)
    1. Install dependencies:

        ```
        npm install
        ```
    1. Launch local dev server:

        ```
        npm start
        ```
        (opens dev server in browser)

    1. Verify changes on localhost server (updates automatically when files are changed).

- Using an Nginx Docker image

    1. [Install Docker Toolkit](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-toolbox)

    1. Configure your shell:
        ```
        eval $(/usr/local/bin/docker-machine env default)
        ```
    1. Build the website server Docker image:

        ```
        ci/docker-build-image.sh
        ```
    1. Run the website server in Docker:

        ```
        SERVER_CID="$(ci/docker-run.sh)"
        ```
    1. By default, the server runs on port 80. You can find the server IP by running
        ```
        docker-machine ip default
        ```

    1. Stop the website server:

        ```
        docker rm -f "${SERVER_CID}"
        ```

## Promoting site to live

To promote the dev site to live, rebase `develop` to `master`:

```
$ git checkout develop
$ git pull
$ ci/promote.sh
```

Continuous integration will handle deploying updates (`ci/deploy.sh`), updating redirects (`ci/update-redirects.sh`), and updating the S3 website config (`ci/update-website-conifg.sh`).

## Managing redirects

There are two types of redirects, stored in two different files:

- Page Redirects: `https://github.com/dcos/dcos-website/redirect-files`
- Prefix Redirects: `https://github.com/dcos/dcos-website/redirect-prefixes`

That both use following format:

```
/from/ /to/
```

Both types of redirects are processed and used in the S3, npm/gulp, and docker/nginx environments.

The "current" version of DC/OS that corresponds to `/docs/latest/` is managed in the `redirect-prefixes` file.

## Versioning

- To create a new version picker dropdown item, modify `layouts/docs.jade` and `gulpfile.js`.

-  When a new version GAs, modify the `redirect-prefixes` file. For example, this denotes that 1.8 is the default version:

   ```
   /docs/latest/ /docs/1.8/
   ```


## Link checking

Validating links requires building and running a local site. You can run a local site as a standalone process or alternatively as a part of a [docs build](#updating-the-documentation).

1. Build the website server Docker image:

    ```
    ci/docker-build-image.sh
    ```
1. Start the website server in Docker and remember the container ID:

    ```
    SERVER_CID="$(PORT=3000 ci/docker-run.sh)"
    ```
1. Run link validation in Docker:

    ```
    ci/docker-validate-links.sh
    ```
1. Stop the website server

    ```
    docker rm -f "${SERVER_CID}"
    ```
