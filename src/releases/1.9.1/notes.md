# <a name="whats-new"></a>What's New

### Apache Mesos 1.2 and Marathon 1.4 integrated

- Marathon 1.4.5 [release notes](https://github.com/mesosphere/marathon/releases/tag/v1.4.5).
- Apache Mesos 1.2.1 [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/mesosphere/mesos/blob/dcos-mesos-1.2.1-rc1/CHANGELOG).

## Container Orchestration
Added support for pods, GPUs, and made significant scalability improvements.

#### Pods
Multiple co-located containers per instance, scheduled on the same host. For more information, see the [documentation](/docs/1.9/deploying-services/pods/).

#### GPU
- Leverage GPUs to run novel algorithms.
- Because DC/OS GPU support is compatible with nvidia-docker, you can test locally with nvidia-docker and then deploy to production with DC/OS.
- Allocate GPUs on a per container basis, including isolation guarantees

For more information, see the [documentation](/docs/1.9/deploying-services/gpu/).

### Remote Process Injection for Debugging

The new `dcos task exec` command allows you to remotely execute a process inside the container of a deployed Mesos task, providing the following features.
- An optional `--interactive` flag for interactive sessions.
- Attach to a remote pseudoterminal (aka PTY) inside a container via the optional `--tty` flag.
- Combine the `--interactive` and `--tty` flags to launch an interactive bash session or to run `top` and see the resource usage of your container in real time.

For more information, see the documentation for the debugging [documentation](/docs/1.9/monitoring/debugging/).

### Logging

Stream task and system logs to journald by setting the `mesos_container_log_sink` install-time parameter to `journald` or `journald+logrotate`. This allows you to:
- Include task metadata like container ID in your queries to more easily locate the logs that you want.
- Use new DC/OS CLI commands `dcos node log` and `dcos task log` DC/OS CLI commands to query the logs. You can also make requests directly against the new Logging API.
- Set up log aggregation solutions such as Logstash to get logs into their aggregated storage solutions.

For more information, see the [documentation](/docs/1.9/monitoring/logging/).

### Metrics

- Node-level HTTP API that returns metrics from frameworks, cgroup allocations per container, and host level metrics such as load and memory allocation.
- StatsD endpoint in every container for forwarding metrics to the DC/OS metrics service. This service is what exposes the HTTP API.
- Any metric sent to STATSD_UDP_HOST/PORT is available in the HTTP API `/container/<container_id>/app` endpoint.

For more information, see the [documentation](/docs/1.9/metrics/).

### Tool for Troubleshooting Service Deployment Failures

- The new service deployment troubleshooting tool allows you to find out why your applications arenâ€™t starting from the GUI and CLI.

### Improved GUI

- New look and feel and improved navigation.

## <a name="networking-services"></a>Networking Services

- CNI support for 3rd party CNI plugins.
- Performance improvements across all networking features.

## <a name="other-improvements"></a>Other Improvements

### DC/OS Internals

- Update DC/OS internal JDK to 8u112 for security [fixes](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/2col/8u112-bugfixes-3124974.html).
- Update DC/OS internal Python from 3.4 to 3.5.
- The `dcos_generate_config.sh --aws-cloudformation` command will now determine the region of the s3 bucket automatically, preventing region mistakes.
- Added the `dcos_add_user.py` script, which you can use to add or invites users to a DC/OS cluster from the command line. For more information, see the [documentation](/docs/1.9/security/add-user-script/). <!-- OSS only -->
- Added `dcos-shell` which activates the DC/OS environment for running other DC/OS command line tools.

### Expanded OS Support

- CentOS [7.3](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/7.3_Release_Notes/index.html) is the default version. If you install DC/OS 1.9 by using the [GUI](/docs/1.9/installing/custom/gui/) or [CLI](/docs/1.9/installing/custom/cli/) install methods, your system will be automatically upgraded to CentOS 7.3.
- CoreOS [1235.12.0](https://coreos.com/releases/#1235.12.0).

### Expanded Docker Engine Support

- Docker 1.12 and 1.13 are now [supported](/docs/1.9/installing/custom/system-requirements/). Docker 1.13 is the default version.

### Upgrades

Improved upgrade tooling and experience for on-premise installations. Upgrades now use internal DC/OS APIs to ensure nodes can be upgraded with minimal disruption to running DC/OS services on a node. The upgrade procedure has also been simplified to improve user experience.

For more information, see the [documentation](/docs/1.9/installing/upgrading/).

# <a name="known-issues"></a>Known Issues and Limitations

- DCOS_OSS-691 - DNS becomes briefly unavailable during DC/OS version upgrades.
- DCOS-14005 - Marathon-LB does not support pods.
- DCOS-14021 - [Task logging to journald](/docs/1.9/monitoring/logging/) disabled by default, so task logs will continue to be written to their sandboxes, and logrotated out. The `- DCOS task log` command will work as it did before.
- DCOS-14433 - The [Universal container runtime](/docs/1.9/deploying-services/containerizers/) does not support Azure cloud with Ubuntu.
- DCOS-16350 - You cannot retrieve metrics emitted by an application over statsd unless they are sent in a single batch. If statsd metrics are sent as a sequence of messages, only the most recently received metric will be available from the `/app` endpoint.
- DCOS-16737 - You cannot [generate and publish AWS Advanced Templates](/docs/1.9/installing/cloud/aws/advanced/#create-your-templates) to AWS GovCloud regions. When running the command `dcos_generate_config.sh --aws-cloudformation` with GovCloud credentials you will see an error similar to this:

  ```bash
  $ ./dcos_generate_config.ee.sh --aws-cloudformation
  ====> EXECUTING AWS CLOUD FORMATION TEMPLATE GENERATION
  Generating configuration files...
  Starting new HTTPS connection (1): s3.amazonaws.com
  aws_template_storage_region_name: Unable to determine region location of s3 bucket testbucket: An error occurred (InvalidAccessKeyId) when calling the GetBucketLocation operation: The AWS Access Key Id you provided does not exist in our records.
  ```
