# Abstract

A lot of talks will tell you how to setup a systems correctly. This talk is about what not to do with your Apache Mesos and DC/OS cluster.

We will share some of our favorite/scariest support stories covering typical system-setup, configuration, and application pitfalls for new (and not-so-new) Mesos and DC/OS operators. And, we will give some hints about how to debug those pitfalls if you do encounter them, resulting in fewer nightmares.
