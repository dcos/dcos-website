# Agenda
## The SMACK Stack is the New LAMP Stack

Presenter: Kevin Stoll

The SMACK stack owes its growing momentum to several things. First, most modern enterprise application use cases like IoT, anomaly detection, predictive analytics, and real-time personalisation require data processing at scale. Spark, Kafka, Cassandra are some of the most popular cloud-native data services that have been proven to do just that.
