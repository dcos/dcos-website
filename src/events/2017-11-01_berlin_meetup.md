# Abstract

MesosCon, the Apache Mesos conference, happens three times a year with an event in Asia, North America and Europe. This meetup will gather speakers local to Berlin who participated in and around the most recent MesosCons in North America and Europe, and give them an opportunity to share their experience and expertise with attendees, as well as shortened versions of their full conference talks.

The event begins with an introduction from Mesosphere Developer Advocate Elizabeth K. Joseph, who will provide an overview of conferences, providing key insights and takeaways.

Till Rohrmann of Data Artisans then will present on "Apache Flink Meets Apache Mesos and DC/OS"

Then Kevin Klues of Mesosphere joins us to give his "Running Distributed TensorFlow on DC/OS" talk

The event concludes with a talk by Tim Nolet from magnetic.io on "How to extend Marathon-LB with Canary releasing features using Vamp"
