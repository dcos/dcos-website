# Abstract

Elizabeth K. Joseph joins us to give an introduction to DC/OS.

Tooling around container orchestration has gained a lot of attention recently with various open source tools promising to deliver the framework to manage a highly available container infrastructure. This talk will explore DC/OS (the datacenter operating system) an open-source, distributed operating system based on the Apache Mesos distributed systems kernel. DC/OS manages multiple machines in the cloud or on-premises from a single interface; deploys containers, distributed services, and legacy applications into those machines; and provides networking, service discovery and resource management to keep the services running and communicating with each other.

A demo using real streaming will also be given to show how DC/OS can easily use various popular open source big data tools to process data coming in and present it to the user.
