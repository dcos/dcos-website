# Abstract

Open source container technologies have become an important component of application testing and microservices deployments in CI/CD pipelines recently. Benefits for using containers in testing include better utilization of testing resources and ability to easily have identical environments for local development, testing and production microservices. Additionally, Jenkins has plugins for popular containerization platforms including <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/kubernetes-plugin">Kubernetes</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/mesos-plugin">Apache Mesos</a>. The talk will conclude with a demonstration of a simple, fully open source, CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins, GitLab and Apache Mesos via DC/OS.
