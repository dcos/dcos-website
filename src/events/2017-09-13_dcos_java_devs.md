# Abstract

In the era of docker, big data and microservices it is really important to distribute your applications reasonable across your cluster and keep a good overview of all of your running applications. Because of this, cluster management software like Apache Mesos and DC/OS are very important and popular. In this session we will implement a java based service using spring boot and will start him locally and with docker-compose. Then we will deploy our service to DC/OS and see how easy it is to scale, upgrade, monitor and do other fancy stuff. And the best thing for the demo: We will have a nice UI and super cool CLI.
