# Abstract

Join us for a 3 hour workshop filled with quality training, good company, and tasty snacks. In this hands-on technical workshop you will learn how best to deploy, operate, and scale Kubernetes clusters from one to hundreds of nodes using DC/OS. You will learn how to integrate and run Kubernetes alongside traditional applications and fast data services of your choice (e.g. Apache Cassandra, Apache Kafka, Apache Spark, TensorFlow, and more) on any infrastructure.

This workshop best suits operators focussed on keeping their apps and services up and running in production and developers focussed on quickly delivering internal and customer facing apps into production.

You will learn how to:

* Deploy Kubernetes on DC/OS in a secure, highly available, and fault-tolerant manner
* Solve operational challenges of running a large/multiple Kubernetes cluster
* One-click deploy big data stateful and stateless services alongside a Kubernetes cluster

In addition to learning about how to scale Kubernetes, you’ll also get a chance to provide feedback and influence the product direction of Mesosphere DC/OS. Kubernetes on DC/OS is currently in beta form and we look forward to receiving your feedback to influence future development.

Prerequisites:

Some knowledge of the Kubernetes and Mesosphere DC/OS ecosystem is helpful, but not required. Each participant should bring his own laptop with some way of sshing into a remote linux system.
