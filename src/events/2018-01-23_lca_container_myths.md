# Abstract

## Day 2 Operations with Containers: Myth vs. Reality

Containers have been hailed as an easy solution to many problems, from software testing to scaling stateless workloads in production. But anyone can write a deployment tool for a container-based infrastructure, the hard work comes when you get to day 2 and you need to handle the day to day operations and maintenance. Metrics, monitoring, logs, debugging, backups and upgrades are all considerations that systems administrators need to take into account before they invest in a solution.

Through lessons learned from direct experience in operations, as well as feedback from open source DC/OS community members, this talk will pull back the curtain to show the internals of how to handle these day 2 operations. It will also provide a checklist of things you want make sure are included when you build a plan for building and maintaining your infrastructure (hint: Logging should never be an afterthought).
