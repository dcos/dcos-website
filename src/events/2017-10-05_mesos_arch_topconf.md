# Abstract

The architecture of applications have changed rapidly to face the growing amount of users and data. Applications are separated to smaller, containerized, distributed and collaborating services which should scale independently. Distributed systems rely on different rules than classical monolithic applications. To minimize this problems, Mesos abstracts the complexity of distributed systems and is established as cluster manager for many big applications. 

In this session Karsten will how the idea and approach of cluster resource offerings build with Apache Mesos, they will introduce DC/OS (datacenter operating system) which is build on top of Mesos and show all the awesome features live during a huge DEMO.
