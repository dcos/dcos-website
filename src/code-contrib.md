## Contributing code

The precise process for contributing code to DC/OS currently varies depending on the DC/OS repo you'd like to contribute to. If there's a [working group](https://github.com/dcos/community/wiki#working-groups) that covers your area of interest, join it and talk with the group leader about what you'd like to do. If not, don't be shy to contact the person who contributes most often to your repo of interest. Once you've discussed your project, you might be asked to create a JIRA ticket to track work, follow contribution instructions in the repo's README.md, or both.

Overall, DC/OS's contribution process is modeled after the [ASF process](https://community.apache.org/contributors/) with a strong emphasis on individual contributors. The following are the four pillars of the DC/OS governance:

(1) Everyone who uses DC/OS is a contributor and is encouraged to provide feedback on the usage of DC/OS, for example by raising a [JIRA](https://jira.dcos.io/) ticket or via [Slack](http://chat.dcos.io).

(2) Any contributor can also eventually be selected as a committer, with the difference that a committer has push access to all the DC/OS repos.

(3) A dedicated Github organization called  [github.com/dcos-labs](https://github.com/dcos-labs) provides a sandboxed environment for new or experimental projects. Any DC/OS contributor can ask to add a project in dcos-labs if they have a champion from the PMC.
