        h2 Welcome
        p Welcome to the Mesosphere DC/OS community! We're looking for contributors to help us with participation at in person events, blog posts, demos, documentation, bug reporting, development of packages, UX research, and more. Participation in the DC/OS community is governed by our #[a(href='https://dcos.io/coc/') Code of Conduct].

        h2 Content
        p If you'd like to start an event or create content about DC/OS (a video, blog, slide deck, meetup group, etc.), let us know via #[a(href='http://chat.dcos.io/') Slack] or email us at  #[a(href='mailto:community-team@dcos.io') community-team@dcos.io]. You don't need permission, but we'd like to know so that we can support your work!

        h2 Documentation
        p If you'd like to contribute to the documentation, which includes demos and tutorials, please follow the directions in the documentation  #[a(href='https://github.com/dcos/dcos-docs/#contributing') GitHub Repo], and don't be shy to @mention docs-team members on your PR.

        h2 Bug reporting and tracking
        p You can report or track DC/OS bugs in #[a(href='https://jira.dcos.io') JIRA]. In order to create a new issue, you'll need to sign in or #[a(href='mailto:community-team@dcos.io') request a new account]. When filing an issue please specify what type it is: for software bugs specify 'Bug', or to suggest how to make DC/OS even more awesome, select 'Improvement'. The more detailed your description is, the easier it is for us to react to it.

        include:markdown code-contrib.md

        h2 Packages in the Universe
        p In addition to the services currently #[a(href='https://github.com/mesosphere/universe/tree/version-3.x/repo/packages') published] you're welcome to publish your own service in the D2iQ Universe (the package repository installed by default on DC/OS, which is not technically part of DC/OS proper). If you're unsure how to proceed, send us an email via #[a(href='mailto:oss-team@d2iq.com') oss-team@d2iq.com] and D2iQ will work with you from there.

        h2 D2iQ's UX research
        p If you are interested in participating in D2iQ's user experience research and usability tests please #[a(href='http://uxresearch.d2iq.com') add yourself to this list]. D2iQ compensates participants with swag and gift cards.
